This repo houses projects that my son and I have created.  We are also sharing our creations with other children on our AWANA robotics club at Peavine Baptist Church in Rock Spring, GA.

## rubberband turret (arduino uno)
This machine uses three continuous servo motors to rotate, raise, and fire up to five rubber bands.  It is controlled using a wii nunchuck.  The device requires the wiichuck adapter, [WiiChuck-SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9281). More details to come.
