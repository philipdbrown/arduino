## rubberband turret (arduino uno/leonardo)
This machine uses three continuous servo motors to rotate, raise, and fire up to five rubber bands.  It is controlled using a wii nunchuck.  The device requires the wiichuck adapter, [WiiChuck-SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9281).  
The Arduino Leonardo version accounts for the changes in the board affecting the use of the wiichuck adapter.
